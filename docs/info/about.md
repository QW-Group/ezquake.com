# About

## History

<a href="http://idsoftware.com">id Software</a> created Quake in 1996, and released the source code to the engine (under the GPL licence) in 1999. Tonik
developed the ZQuake QuakeWorld client from this, before fuh took ZQuake and turned it into FuhQuake.

The ezQuake project started in August 2004 as a derivative of FuhQuake, and today is the dominant QuakeWorld client for those playing online competitively.

## Contribute

<p class="subtitle">ezQuake is constantly evolving, and there are a number of ways to contribute.</p>

### Write some code

The central repository for ezQuake is stored on <a href="https://github.com/ezQuake/ezquake-source">GitHub</a>. ezQuake is open to new developers, feel free to
experiment and submit pull requests.

### Write some documentation

Documentation doesn't always keep up with code changes, and ezquake's is no different. There is a lot of information in older guides on SourceForge, that need
updated and ported over to GitHub Pages (<a href="https://github.com/ezQuake/ezquake.github.io">repo</a>).

If you notice errors in the documentation for console variables or commands (available in-game through the /describe command), feel free to let us know. Even
better, modify the help files and submit pull requests as above.

### Report bugs

Help us improve the client by <a href="https://github.com/ezQuake/ezquake-source/issues">reporting bugs</a>. If you can, please include any steps you used to
reproduce the bug, any screenshots showing examples of the problem, etc. The easier it is for us to replicate, the quicker we can get it fixed.

### Feature requests

We consider all reasonable feature requests, and try to support the QuakeWorld community in whatever it needs. The best place to start is to discuss new ideas
on the <a href="http://www.quakeworld.nu/forum">forums</a>. If it captures the imagination of the community then it is more likely to be included in a future
release.
