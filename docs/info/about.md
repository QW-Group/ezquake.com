# About

## History

[id Software](http://idsoftware.com) created Quake in 1996, and released the [source code](https://github.com/id-Software/Quake) to the engine (under the GPL
licence) in 1999.

Tonik developed the ZQuake QuakeWorld client from this, before fuh took ZQuake and turned it into FuhQuake.

The ezQuake project started in August 2004 as a derivative of FuhQuake, and today is the dominant QuakeWorld client for those playing online competitively.

## Contribute

ezQuake is constantly evolving and there are multiple ways to contribute.

### Develop ezQuake

[The ezQuake repository](https://github.com/qw-group/ezquake-source) is stored on GitHub - feel free to experiment and submit pull requests.

### Update documentation

If you find errors in the documentation, feel free to let us know. Even better, modify the help files (using the "Edit this page" link found on each page
footer) and submit
pull requests.

### Report bugs

Help us improve the client by [reporting bugs](https://github.com/qw-group/ezquake-source/issues). If you can, please include any steps you used to reproduce
the bug, any screenshots showing examples of the problem, etc. The easier it is for us to replicate, the quicker we can get it fixed.

### Submit feature requests

We consider all reasonable feature requests and try to support the QuakeWorld community in whatever it needs.

The best place to start is to discuss new ideas in `#dev-corner` on the [QuakeWord discord](https://discord.quake.world). If it captures the imagination of the
community then it is more likely to be included in a future release.
